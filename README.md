# Election 2024 Predictions Python Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Election 2024 Predictions Python Project repository. This project aims to predict election outcomes for the 2024 elections in Pakistan using historical data, machine learning models, and advanced data preprocessing techniques. By leveraging data from previous elections (1997, 2002, 2008, 2013), the project provides insights into potential voting patterns and candidate performance across districts and constituencies.

### Key Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Extract, clean, and preprocess election data from multiple sources to ensure data quality and consistency. Includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation tasks.
  
- **Prediction Models**: Implement various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting to predict election results. Models are trained on historical data and evaluated for accuracy and performance metrics.
  
- **Visualization and Analysis**: Generate visualizations (charts, graphs, maps) to illustrate election trends, demographic insights, and predictive outcomes. Analyze data patterns and correlations to understand factors influencing election results.
  
- **Prediction Results**: Produce detailed reports and predictions at different levels (district, constituency, national) to facilitate decision-making and strategic planning for political campaigns and stakeholders.

### Directory Structure

- **data/**: Contains both raw and processed election data.
  - **raw/**: Raw data files downloaded or acquired from official sources.
  - **processed/**: Cleaned and preprocessed data used for modeling and analysis.
  
- **models/**: Stores trained machine learning models serialized for prediction purposes.
  
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
  
- **results/**: Stores generated prediction results, visualizations (charts, graphs), and analysis reports.
  
- **utils/**: Helper functions and scripts for general-purpose tasks and data manipulation.
